# My various codes and projects in java

Java was first object-oriented programming language I have learned on a high level. The knowledge of Java, learned from school was used on creating projects throughout the semesters and projects outside school. From creating my first Hello World application, through first database connection to creating first RESTful API with Spring, Java is a language from which I got all foundation of object-oriented programming.
